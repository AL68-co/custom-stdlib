# Custom stdlib (in lack of a better name) (Recent Windows only)

The goal is to re-implement the FFI part of stdlib (e.g. part or whole `std::{fs,net,thread,sync}` modules), directly in Windows API calls.

I will try to keep the same-ish API, but I will not promise anything.

This is a personal research project, not production-ready.
